## certificate
Creates an HTTPS certificate and saves it in the local "certificate" directory.

### Examples
1. `share certificate`
   - By default a certificate authority (CA) certificate is created.
1. `share certificate /file/path/to/save`
   - Provide a file system path of where to save certificates. If no path is provided the default location is "(project path)/lib/certificate". If the file path is relative it will be relative to the current working directory.

## directory
Traverses a directory in the local file system and generates a list.  If a source is not provided the current working directory is used.

### Examples
1. `share directory source:"my/directory/path"`
   - Returns an array where each index is an array of [absolute path, type, parent index, file count, stat]. Type can refer to 'file', 'directory', or 'link' for symbolic links.  The parent index identify which index in the array is the objects containing directory and the file count is the number of objects a directory type object contains.
1. `share directory source:"my/directory/path" depth:9`
   - The depth of child directories to traverse. The default value of 0 applies full recursion.
1. `share directory source:"my/directory/path" symbolic`

1. `share hash file/system/path digest:base64`
   - By default hash values are generated as strings in hexadecimal notation, but some operations may require base64 strings. Supported values: 'base64', 'hex'

## lint
Use ESLint against all JavaScript files in a specified directory tree.

### Examples
1. `share lint ../tools`
   - Lints all the JavaScript files in that location and in its subdirectories.
1. `share lint`
   - Specifying no location defaults to the Share File Systems application directory.
1. `share lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]`
   - An ignore list is also accepted if there is a list wrapped in square braces following the word 'ignore'.

## mkdir
Recursively creates a directory structure.  For example if 'my/new/path` were to be created but parent 'my' doesn't exist this command will create all three directories, but it will not alter or overwrite any artifacts already present. Relative paths are relative to the terminal's current working directory.

### Examples
1. `share mkdir my/path/to/create`
   - This example would create directories as necessary to ensure the directory structure 'my/path/to/create' is available from the location relative to the terminal's current working directory.

## remove
Remove a file or directory tree from the local file system.

### Examples
1. `share remove path/to/resource`
   - Removes the specified resource.
1. `share remove "C:\Program Files"`
   - Quote the path if it contains non-alphanumeric characters.

## service
Launches a localhost HTTP service and web sockets so that the web tool is automatically refreshed once code changes in the local file system.

### Examples
1. `share service`
   - Launches the service on default port 443 (80 insecure) and web sockets on port 444 (81 insecure).
1. `share service 8080`
   - If a numeric argument is supplied the web service starts on the port specified and web sockets on the following port.
1. `share service 0`
   - To receive a random available port specify port number 0.
1. `share service browser`
   - The 'browser' argument launches the default location in the user's default web browser.
1. `share service test`
   - The 'test' argument tells the service to use data from a separate settings location for running tests instead of the user's actual data.
1. `share service test browser 9000`
   - An example with multiple supported arguments.  The supported arguments may occur in any order.
1. `share service ip:192.168.1.125`
   - An argument that begins with 'ip:' forces use of the specified IP address.  Any string passed as an address will be attempted as a service hostname, but will error if not a locally available IP address.
1. `share service secure`
   - The 'secure' argument forces the service to use secure protocols: HTTPS and WSS.  If both 'secure' and 'insecure' arguments are supplied 'secure' takes precedence.  A secure server requires that a certificate in PEM format with file extension 'crt' be saved in 'lib/certificate' directory under this project along with its corresponding key file.
1. `share service insecure`
   - The 'insecure' argument forces the service to use insecure protocols: HTTP and WS.  If both 'secure' and 'insecure' arguments are supplied 'secure' takes precedence.

## test
Builds the application and then runs all the test commands

### Examples
1. `share test`
   - Runs all the tests in the test suite.

## test_browser
Launches the 'service' command as a child process, launches the default browser to execute DOM instructions as intervals of test automation, and then closes the browser upon completion.

### Examples
1. `share test_browser`
   - Runs the browser interaction tests.
1. `share test_browser no_close`
   - Disables the 'window.close()' command at the end of test instructions so that the browser remains open for manual inspection.
1. `share test_browser demo`
   - Same as the 'no_close' argument but also imposes a half second delay between actions so that a person can watch the interactions.
1. `share test_browser mode:"self"`
   - The mode parameter determines what tests to execute. The value 'self', the default value, only execute tests using the local computer.
1. `share test_browser mode:"device"`
   - The value 'device' executes tests requiring additional computers that are 'device' type and not 'user' type. This mode requires 4 other computers executing in mode 'remote'.
1. `share test_browser mode:"user"`
   - The value 'user' executes tests requiring additional computers that are 'device' and 'user' types. This mode requires 4 other computers executing in mode 'remote'.
1. `share test_browser mode:"remote"`
   - The value 'remote' puts a computer into listening mode awaiting instructions from a computer executing 'agents' tests. Computers in this mode will not exit the service automatically.
1. `share test_browser "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" no_close`
   - By default tests only execute against the default browser.  To test against other locally installed browsers simply provide the absolute path to the browser binary.

## test_service
Launches the 'service' command as a child process to issue HTTP requests against it and test the results

### Examples
1. `share test_service`
   - Runs tests service utility.
1. `share test_service fs-copy`
   - Filter the tests to run by supplying a text fragment to filter against test names.  For example if there are 6 service tests whose names contain that string then only those 6 tests will be evaluated.
1. `share test_service "Copy from Remote Device to different Remote Device"`
   - Using quotes the filter argument may contain spaces and other non-alpha characters.

## test_simulation
Launches a test runner to execute the various commands of the services file.

### Examples
1. `share test_simulation`
   - Runs tests against the commands offered by the services file.
1. `share test_simulation help`
   - Filter the tests to run by supplying a text fragment to filter against test names.  For example if there are 6 service tests whose names contain that string then only those 6 tests will be evaluated.
1. `share test_simulation "hash ~/share-file-systems list ignore ['node_modules'"`
   - Using quotes the filter argument may contain spaces and other non-alpha characters.

## update
Pulls code from the git repository of the current git remote and branch, rebuilds the application, then executes a command. The child command will always execute from the project's absolute directory.

### Examples
1. `share update`
   - If no additional arguments are provided the child command to execute will be: share service
1. `share update test_browser`
   - The child command will be: share test_browser
1. `share update lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]`
   - All arguments are passed into the child command equivalent to: share lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]

## version
Prints the current version number and date of prior modification to the console.

### Examples
1. `share version`
   - Prints the current version number and date to the shell.

## websocket
Launches a localhost web socket server.

### Examples
1. `share websocket`

1. `share service 8080`
   - If a numeric argument is supplied the server starts on the port specified.
1. `share service 0`
   - To force a random available port specify port number 0.
1. `share service ip:192.168.1.125`
   - An argument that begins with 'ip:' forces use of the specified IP address.  Any string passed as an address will be attempted as a service hostname, but will error if not a locally available IP address.
1. `share service secure`
   - The 'secure' argument forces the server to use secure protocol WSS.  If both 'secure' and 'insecure' arguments are supplied 'secure' takes precedence.  A secure server requires that a certificate in PEM format with file extension 'crt' be saved in 'lib/certificate' directory under this project along with its corresponding key file.
1. `share service insecure`
   - The 'insecure' argument forces the server to use insecure protocol WS.  If both 'secure' and 'insecure' arguments are supplied 'secure' takes precedence.
